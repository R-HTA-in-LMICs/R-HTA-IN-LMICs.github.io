In the first quarter of every year, the chapter hosts a presentation-based workshop where LMIC university students and members of partnership organisations present their R related health economics work. In every subsequent quarter, the chapter hosts introductory, intermediate, and advanced decision modelling workshops applied within an LMIC context.

Note that the date, time, and theme of each workshop will be provided closer to each respective event.

## February workshop
The annual first quarter workshop invites analysts to present their R-related health economics work. Speakers from academia, government, industry, and consulting will give demonstrations of their R code solving specific challenges in HTA, covering a wide range of topics relevant to HTA in LMICs.

### A call for abstracts
The chapter is currently calling for all health analysts to submit abstracts to present at the the inaugural workshop taking place on the 23rd February 2022. You can submit your abstract [here](https://forms.gle/qhuxFzJeusEdMmNcA).

Presentations may follow any format but must be R-related and ought to be as roughly applicable to LMIC contexts as possible. Topics can be wide ranging, and may include subjects such as epidemiology or spatial analysis.

In every second, third, and fourth quarter, the chapter hosts introductory, intermediate, and advanced decision modelling workshops applied within an LMIC context. At each tutorial, participants are given a detailed and technical overview of the topic and are then encouraged to build the model and interact with the presenters to gain a more practical understanding.

# June 2022
Delegates attending this tutorial will be given hands-on experience in building a simple sick-sicker health economics model for HTA, using the DARTH package. This tutorial will:
- give you an overview of basic R syntax;
- help you get to grips with R as a first-time user;
- give you a conceptual introduction to Markov Models; and
- guide you through a simple cost-effectiveness model using the DARTH package

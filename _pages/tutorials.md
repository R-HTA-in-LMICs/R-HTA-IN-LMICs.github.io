In every second, third, and fourth quarter, the chapter hosts introductory, intermediate, and advanced decision modelling workshops applied within an LMIC context. At each tutorial, participants are given a detailed and technical overview of the topic and are then encouraged to build the model and interact with the presenters to gain a more practical understanding.

# 21 June 2022
Delegates attending this tutorial will be given hands-on experience in building a simple sick-sicker health economics model for HTA, using the DARTH package. 

This tutorial will:
- give you an overview of basic R language;
- help you get to grips with R as a first-time user;
- give you a conceptual introduction to Markov Models; and
- guide you through a simple cost-effectiveness model using the DARTH package

Delegates attending this tutorial will be given hands-on experience in building a simple sick-sicker health economics model for HTA, using the DARTH package. 

This intermediate tutorial aims to:
- build on an introductory tutorial;
- help you develop a deeper understanding of the R language and its applicability to decision-modelling in health economics;
- provide a conceptual introduction to time-dependent Markov Models; and
- code a time-dependent Markov model from scratch, for a hypothetical cost-effectiveness analysis.

In every second, third, and fourth quarter, the chapter hosts introductory, intermediate, and advanced decision modelling workshops applied within an LMIC context. At each tutorial, participants are given a detailed and technical overview of the topic and are then encouraged to build the model and interact with the presenters to gain a more practical understanding.

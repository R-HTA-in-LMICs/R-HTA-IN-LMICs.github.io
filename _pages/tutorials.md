The chapter hosts introductory, intermediate, and advanced decision modelling workshops annually that are applied within an LMIC context. 

At each tutorial, participants are given a detailed and technical overview of the topic and are then encouraged to build the model and interact with the presenters to gain a more practical understanding.


# 25 September 2023
Participants will be given hands-on experience in building a simple sick-sicker health economics model for HTA, using the DARTH package. 

This tutorial will:
- give you an overview of the R language;
- help you get to grips with R as a first-time user;
- give you a conceptual introduction to Markov Models; and
- guide you through a simple CEA  model assessing the cost-effectiveness of comparator ARV regimens for HIV/AIDS

# 20 January 2023
Participants will be given hands-on experience in converting a model built in Excel to R and building an interactive model using Rshiny. 

This intermediate tutorial aims to:
- build on the September 2022 intermediary tutorial;
- Converting your model from Excel to R: a case study in HIV/AIDS
- Making health economics Shiny to improve model transparency and usability
- Understanding Shiny interactions and converting your R script into a Shiny model
- Making your Shiny model probabilistic

# 20 September 2022
Participants will be given hands-on experience in building in undertaking a PSA (probabilistic sensitivity analysis) on a basic sick-sicker decision analytic model for HTA. 

This intermediate tutorial aims to:
- build on our Q2 introductory tutorial;
- help you develop a deeper understanding of the R language and its applicability to decision-modelling in health economics;
- provide a conceptual introduction to time-dependent Markov Models; and
- code a time-dependent Markov model from scratch, for a hypothetical cost-effectiveness analysis.

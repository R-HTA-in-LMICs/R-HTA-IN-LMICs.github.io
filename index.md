intro:
 - excerpt: 'The LMIC chapter aims to bridge the gap in the use of R software among HTA analysts in LMICs. Annually, the chapter hosts a presentation-based workshop where LMIC university students and members of partnership organisations present their R related health economics work. In every subsequent quarter, the chapter hosts introductory, intermediate, and advanced decision modelling workshops applied within an LMIC context. See our events page for more details or, alternatively, contact <training@r-htalmics.org>.'
